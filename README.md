# Introduction
This project is a React.js application that fetches news data from newsapi.org with axios and bootstrap 5 for responsiveness.



# Technologies Used
<ul>
  <li>React.js</li>
  <li>HTML5 and CSS3</li>
  <li>Bootstrap 5</li>
  <li>Axios</li>
</ul> 

# Request failed with status code 426
The error message "Request failed with status code 426" indicates that the HTTP request made to the News API was unsuccessful due to the HTTP status code 426. This status code, specifically "426 Upgrade Required," implies that the client needs to upgrade its current protocol in order to communicate with the server. I build this project using developer version of api so after deployment its showing this error i have provided live-link where you can easily look at it by console 

# To resolve this issue
Upgrade to a paid plan: Contact the News API provider and inquire about their pricing plans. By subscribing to a paid plan, you will gain access to the API for deployment purposes.
